❤️Heart Disease Prediction using KNN

Description:
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model achieves an accuracy of 86%.

The project workflow includes:

Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Conducted in JupyterLab.

Machine Learning Model: Built using KNN to predict heart disease.

Frontend: A user-friendly interface created with Streamlit, allowing users to input patient data and get instant predictions.

The app is live online and accessible here
.

Features:

Enter patient health metrics through an interactive Streamlit interface.

Get real-time heart disease predictions.

Simple and clean user interface for easy use.
